            I'm a Italian content creator with ADHD (Diagnosed) who mostly makes content whenever he wants to.<br>
            I have a massive passion towards Video Games, Music (mainly EDM), Graphic design, etc.<br>
            I often make Roblox renders and whenever I want to I work on some music (I often make <a style="color: red;">Uptempo Hardcore, Speedcore and even <a
            style="color: rgb(170, 0, 0);">Extratone</a></a> music).

            <p style="text-align: left;">I am using this site to introduce myself, I don't really do a ton of stuff other than whatever I've mentioned on top, I'm really interested into stuff such as
            Computers, Technology (In general) and much more, I started making music back in 2021 with FL Studio Mobile, from my experience, FL Studio Mobile is
            <b style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204); font-style: italic;">ok(?)</b> as a DAW <a style="font-size: 8px;">(Digital Audio Workstation)</a>, not bad but not good, I moved on to
            FL Studio in 2022 after I got a gaming PC.<br>I'm currently making music with FL Studio v25.1.5 and nothing else, I often take a week or a month to finish a full track and
            you're wondering with how long I take to make an album, it depends if I got the motivation or not.<br><br>
            I like to play rhythm games, FPS <a style="font-size: 8px;">(First Person Shooter)</a> games and also platformers!!<br>
            I'm a really silly guy :P</p>
